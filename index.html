      <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>At my core, I am a person who finds joy in helping others. I am a geek with a big heart. I am a Marine Corps veteran who became a social worker who became a data analyst, 
          who is moving into software engineering. I find meaning in my life by making a difference in other's lives and by being a positive influence in this world. 
          I get energized by solving those problems that everyone said couldn't be solved. I get excited about things like process improvement and efficiency. I am not afraid to use Google. 
          I like to dive into manuals, StackOverflow, and any other resource at my disposal to find the answers I need. I am an introvert that works well with others,
          has strong communication and presentation skills, and has many different interests and passions from which to draw new ideas and solutions.</p>
      <h2>Software Engineering Experience</h2>
        <p>I am a self-taught programmer and enrolled in Code Fellows to further enhance my job readiness and programming skillset.</p>
        <p>I started in middle school building computers, but for some reason shied away from programming at that time. After a career-detour-and-life-experience-enhancer called the military, and college, I found myself doing a freelance
          job that required knowing some JavaScript to add functionality to PDF forms. In learning the skills that I needed to complete the work, I found myself in a 
          new world I found incredibly interesting. It sparked the beginnings of a career transition which led me to MOHAI (the Museum of History &amp; Industry), where
          I am the Data Manager &amp; Analyst.</p>
        <p>I have taken courses through the University of Washington, MITx, and Harvardx, along with the usual
          assortment of learning through places such as Treehouse and Codeacademy, and am currently enrolled in Code Fellows.</p>

      <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        <p>A contact page should have contact info on it right? I wish the internet was a super chill place where I could post my email, phone number, address, favorite coffee shop, and current location for all to see.</p>
        <p>I think I would regret that.</p>
        <p>So I only post that stuff on accepted social media channels...you know, like everyone else. </p>
        <p>If you want to talk business, connect with me on one of the following places:</p>
