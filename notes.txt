Remove the "Code Away" from footer

Seems like Github should be integrated in projects

Could breakout templates into separate file (template.html)
  -- would need to use ajax call to grab the file
  -- check Handlebars docs

Why am I passing in jQuery and other globally scoped objects into the modules?
I should start learning ES6 import/export
Probably avoid this passing

950px for min-width of desktop seems high, could probably lower this to 650??

Look into Gulp -- execute a build that would turn all my js into one big bundle
Webpack is the latest and greatest, but has a really steep learning curve
